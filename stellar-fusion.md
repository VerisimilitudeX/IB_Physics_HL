# Stellar Fusion

- More massive stars have more fusion because they need to undergo more fusion in order to balance the higher gravitational force.

- More massive stars live longer because they undergo fusion more slowly.

- VERY massive stars become supernovae because the force of gravity overcomes the force of fusion when fusion ends.

# Radioactive Decay

| Decay Type | Particle | Example | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Alpha decay | Alpha particles | Po-210 to Pb-206 | Releases energy. Can't go through things, doesn't hurt you because it's just helium. |
| Beta decay | High energy and speed E<sup>-</sup> (electron) or e<sup>+</sup> (positron) | Se-79 to Br-79<sup>-</sup> | Neutron turned into 1 proton and 1 electron and 1 neutrino. Adding 1 proton is not possible because it adds a positive charge, which is not allowed. Weak nuclear force allows up quark to change into a down quark, or vice versa. Will penetrate skin. |
| Gamma decay | High energy and speed gamma **rays** | Co-60 to Co-60<sup>*</sup> | Co-60<sup>*</sup> is an excited state of Co-60. Co-60<sup>*</sup> releases energy in the form of gamma rays. Will penetrate skin. |
